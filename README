This ftplugin has the following features:

Auto-line-numbering: Upon pressing <CR> after a line, the next line has the correct line number. It even renumbers the whole file automatically. So, if you add new lines in the middle of a program, it renumbers the whole file. If you delete a line, just press <M-+> to renumber the file (either in Normal or Insert mode)

Also, shortcuts to usual commands:
<M-L> LBL
<M-l> LBL'    (note: lower case L)
<M-G> GTO
<M-T> RTN
<M-O> STOP
<M-I> ISG
<M-D> DSE
<M-R> RCL
<M-S> STO
<M-X> XEQ
<M-E> ENTER
<M-Y> X<>Y
<M-P> PROMPT
<M-V> VIEW
<M-A> AVIEW
<M-C> CLX
<M-W> Strips the file so that it is ready to be converted to a .RAW file
